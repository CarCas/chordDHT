# chordDHT
Implementation of the distributed hash table chord protocol by using Java.

Simulations have been carried out for analyzing the behaviour of a network depending on how crowded is the network, as explained in the  `chordReport.pdf` file.

The cases carried out are, for a network of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&2^{15}"/>, the following ones:

| Case           | Percentage |
|:----------------:|:---:|
| Very uncrowded | 1% |
| Very uncrowded | 3% |
| Very uncrowded | 5% |
| Uncrowded      | 10% |
| Uncrowded      | 13% |
| Uncrowded      | 15% |
| Standard       | 40% |
| Standard       | 43% |
| Standard       | 45% |
| Crowded        | 60% |
| Crowded        | 63% |
| Crowded        | 65% |
| Very Crowded   | 80% |
| Very Crowded   | 85% |
| Very Crowded   | 90% |

The results and the conclusions have been considered and explained in the `chordReport.pdf` file.
